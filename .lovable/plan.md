## Valentine's Day Card Landing Page

A single-page, interactive Valentine's card with an elegant romantic design and a playful twist - the "No" button that's impossible to click!

### Design & Layout
- **Color scheme**: Deep reds, soft pinks, and cream/white accents
- **Typography**: Elegant script font for the main question, classic serif for buttons
- **Background**: Subtle gradient with floating heart decorations
- **Centered card design** with gentle shadows and rounded corners

### Main Content
- **Header**: "Will you be my Valentine?" in beautiful script typography
- **Two buttons side by side**: "Yes" and "No"
- Optional decorative elements like small hearts or rose petals

### The Magic "No" Button Behavior
- **Desktop**: The "No" button smoothly moves away when the mouse cursor gets close to it (tracking cursor position)
- **Mobile**: Tapping the "No" button causes it to jump to a random new position on the screen
- Smooth transition animations for the movement

### "Yes" Button Result
- When clicked, the card transitions to a celebration screen
- Display a romantic image/GIF (e.g., couple silhouette, roses, hearts)
- Sweet message like "I knew you'd say yes! 💕"
- Confetti or heart animation overlay for extra delight

### Technical Notes
- Pure frontend implementation (no backend needed)
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
- Touch-friendly with appropriate hit targets
